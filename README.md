## Introduction

Sectional title describes the separate ownership of a unit within a group-owned complex or
development. Simply put, the term refers to a complex with flats, townhouses or apartments
that has multiple owners; each owning a section of the overall property. The collective of owners
typically elect a body corporate made up of some of the owners to take responsibility for some
of the tasks required to maintain the property. This includes overseeing the enforcement of rules
and regulations, the security, upkeep and maintenance of the property, and managing
communication with the owners, renters and related parties among other things.

## How to run the app locally

Use this link to access the git-hub repository, [Git-hub Repo](https://github.com/Heisenburg-z/Sectional-titles-property-management).
Clone the project on your machine and install all the dependencies by running the command *npm i*, in the terminal. Prior to installing
all the dependecies, open the project using your editor (preferably VS-Code). Go to your terminal and change the directory to the *api* folder,
and run the command *func start*. **You have to install the Azure extension and also login into your account.** After all the APIs run successfully,
you have to go *src/Pages* directory in your editor and add *http://localhost:7071/* to every file that has code where the API is being used. Make sure 
to check all of this properly as it is crucial for the APIs to run locally. In a new terminal, change the directory to the project folder, and run the 
command *npm start*, this will run the app on your browser. The following details are to be used for the different roles:
