## Introduction

Sectional title describes the separate ownership of a unit within a group-owned complex or
development. Simply put, the term refers to a complex with flats, townhouses or apartments
that has multiple owners; each owning a section of the overall property. The collective of owners
typically elect a body corporate made up of some of the owners to take responsibility for some
of the tasks required to maintain the property. This includes overseeing the enforcement of rules
and regulations, the security, upkeep and maintenance of the property, and managing
communication with the owners, renters and related parties among other things.
